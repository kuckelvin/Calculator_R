# The React Framework - Calculator solution

## Overview
This project focuses on building a calcultor that does basic arithmetic operations. This one functions like the first calculator project, which was build with classes and vanilla JavaScript.

### The Manual

Users of this Calculator should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- view complete arithmetic expressions before result is eventually displayed
- Square root and Percentage functions have been included
- The HISTORY button will be made functional when project is made full stack! Keeping fingers crossed.
